# Changelog

## 0.1.0-preview.1

Initial distributable preview, under the MIT license.

- Published to npm as `@codemeall/agent-fleet` under the `preview` tag: `npx @codemeall/agent-fleet@preview setup`.
- Install with the skills CLI: `npx skills add codemeall/agent-fleet`.
- Install from GitHub without npm: `npx github:codemeall/agent-fleet setup`.
- Add a Claude Code plugin marketplace manifest (`/plugin marketplace add codemeall/agent-fleet`).
- Restructure the README around installation methods.
- Persist ticket dependencies, exact ownership, model/effort assignments and decisions; resume existing runs.
- Track worker exit receipts independently from reports. Failed stops retain capacity; reviewers can use a released writer slot even at capacity one.
- Gate acceptance on lead evidence and required cross-family review of the current scoped diff.
- Compare full Git index entries, quote model arguments, validate IDs and paths, and serialize mutations within a checkout.
- Provide dedicated reviewer prompts and current Matt Pocock skill integration guidance.
- Install durable skill copies for Claude Code, Codex and Cursor, preserving modified or unrelated installations.
- Package the runtime for npm, a Claude plugin at the source root, and a generated Codex plugin bundle. Include MIT notices in standalone copies.
- Add CI and 43 tests, including a real child-process exit receipt and installation from an npm tarball.

Validated locally: automated tests, JavaScript syntax, Claude plugin manifest, generated Codex plugin and skill, and package installation. Live authenticated provider runs and marketplace installation remain unverified. The npm package has not been published by this change.

Existing prototype run records are not automatically migrated: inspect and stop their workers before starting a new run. New run records use schema version 2.
